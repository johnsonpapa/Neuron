# Perceptron
A simple neuron/perceptron class.

Made at my spare time for fun.

## Usage
It is confirmed to be able to act as a linear binary classifier, as show-cased in main.cpp.

## Installation
Download or clone the repository and compile all the files provided.

## Known bugs
Currently unsure why it does not work with TANH being the activation, but requiring it to be within the range of 0 to 1 instead (TANH01 or LOGISTIC).
